    <p><strong>Curbside Thai</strong> brings the rich
      flavor of Thailand to
      North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35
      years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers
      that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte
      with our modern mobile food truck.</p>

    <p>This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy
      paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various
      mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from
      11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and
      11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the
      difference! If you can't get away from your desk,
      <em>Curbside Thai will deliver.</em>.</p>

    <p>Contact us to cater your next party and experience
      what Carolina Traveler calls the finest Asian food
      on or off the streets of Charlotte.</p>
